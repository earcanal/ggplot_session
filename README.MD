# Some ggplot notes

This repository contains the code used to create an RMarkdown presentation on ggplot. It also contains a function, summarySE, mentioned in one of the slides. This function was found here: <http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Summarizing_data/> on the 17/11/2015.

This function can easily be replaced by a much faster and more elegant tidyverse-approach. The slides also include a benchmark between the two approaches.

The presentation used the built-in iris dataset to show some of the options which are possible with ggplot. The code was written and tested on a Windows machine on Windows 7, on RStudio Version 1.0.136 and also on Linux with rstudio-1.0.136 and R-3.3.3.
